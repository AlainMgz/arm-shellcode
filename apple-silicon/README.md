# Apple Silicon Shellcodes

Shellcodes for Apple Silicon computers (M-Series).

The Makefile assumes compilation on a Apple M computer, if that's not the case you might need to adapt the Makefile.

This is the toolchain used:
```bash
$ clang -v
Apple clang version 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.5)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin24.5.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```
